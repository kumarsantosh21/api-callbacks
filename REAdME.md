## Introduction


1. In this repository i did callback code using normal callback, promises and async/await for printing my name. 

* **Callbacks** : A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.This technique allows a function to call another function.A callback function can run after another function has finished.

* **Promises** : A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

* **Async/Await** : An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
2. For this codes i have completed documentation,  unit testing, code coverage.

  npm run doc
  ``` 

## Testing
To test our testcases
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```
## Output
After follow the above process you will get the documentation and coverage folders
*******************************************************
## For visting created post pages follow the process

### Start server
Server started
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```
  After that

* http://localhost:3000/callback
  ```sh
   * Will display Hello name using callback function
    ```
      
* http://localhost:3000/promises
  ```sh
   * Will display Hello name using promises function
  ```
* http://localhost:3000/asaw
  ```sh
   * Will display Hello name using async function
   ```
* http://localhost:3000/api-docs
 ```sh
   * Will output the swagger documentation of our Hello name API
 ```
